The original HESS (Hyper Exponential Space Sorting) is a polynomial black-box optimization algorithm, that work very well with any NP-Complete, or NP-Hard problem.

    usage: hess-knapsack instance

For instances use https://github.com/JorikJooken/knapsackProblemInstances from
"A new class of hard problem instances for the 0â€“1 knapsack problem"

thanks to @JorikJooken for the instances and research.
